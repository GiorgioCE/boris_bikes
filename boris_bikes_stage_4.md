##Stage 4: Refactoring vs New Features

Our feature test is passing ensuring that we are delivering value to our client.  We've got a unit tests for the Bike and DockingStation classes.  However our DockingStation is very tightly coupled to the Bike class.  It might seem obvious that all a DockingStation ever needs to do is release Bikes, but Ruby programmers pride themselves on programming to interfaces (the way obkects behave), not locking an implementation to a particular type of class.  All our feature test requires is that DockingStations provide objects that respond to the 'broken?' method.  Ultimately it doesn't care what the class of the object we are calling it on.  In the future our client might want docking stations to release objects of class MountainBike or Scooter or what have you, and our end user will continue to want objects that are not broken.  

One solution would be to adjust our DockingStation so that we specify what kind of entity to create and release with code like:

```ruby
class DockingStation
  def initialize klass
    @klass = klass
  end
  def release_bike
    klass.new
  end
end
```

and then we'd need to initialise DockingStations like so:

```sh
d = DockingStation.new Bike
```

we get our intended end user functionality

```sh
â†’ irb
2.1.5 :001 > require './lib/docking_station'
 => true
2.1.5 :002 > require './lib/bike'
 => true
2.1.5 :003 > d = DockingStation.new Bike
 => #<DockingStation:0x007fc21a153770 @klass=Bike>
2.1.5 :004 > d.release_bike
 => #<Bike:0x007fc21a150cf0>
2.1.5 :005 > _.broken?
 => nil

and we've completely de-coupled DockingStation from Bike.  It can be tested independently and we don't need to require Bike in the DockingStation class definition and we

[Contrasting UML Diagrams?]

However this sort of refactoring might be considered premature if we consider other user stories, such as these ones, which imply that DockingStations should have a limited capacity for storing bikes.

```sh
As a maintainer of the system,
So that members of the public are not disappointed,
I'd like docking stations to not release bikes when there are none available.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that members of the public can get usable bikes,
I'd like docking stations to not accept more bikes than their capacity.
```

Whenever we have a full suite of passing tests we have the choice of refactoring our code to better support future change, or to try to implement another feature.  In this case since it seems clear that our Docking Stations are not intended to be dispensers of unlimited supplies of new bikes, that it seems sensible to add another feature rather than refactor in a way that might not back sense once we have implemented some capacity for DockingStations.

In this case let's implement a new feature test to reflect the fact that docking stations can run out of bikes.


```ruby
require 'docking_station'

describe 'member of public accesses bike' do
  it 'and it is not broken' do
    docking_station = DockingStation.new
    bike = docking_station.release_bike
    expect(bike).not_to be_broken
  end
  it 'and there are none available' do
    docking_station = DockingStation.new
    expect { docking_station.release_bike }.to raise_error 'No Bikes Available'
  end
end
```

[IRB OF WHAT WE EXPECT INTERACTION TO BE LIKE???]

Now these two feature tests can't both pass.  Either docking stations will start with an initial bike that can be handed out to end users or they will start empty.  We'll need to make a decision here, perhaps in consultation with the client.  However it seems a reasonable assumption that docking stations will start empty, so let's go with that for the time being.  It implies that we'll need to adjust our first user story to ensure that there is a bike to hand out to the first user.

```ruby
require 'docking_station'

describe 'member of public accesses bike' do
  it 'and it is not broken' do
    docking_station = DockingStation.new
    docking_station.dock Bike.new
    bike = docking_station.release_bike
    expect(bike).not_to be_broken
  end
  it 'and there are none available' do
    docking_station = DockingStation.new
    expect { docking_station.release_bike }.to raise_error 'No Bikes Available'
  end
end
```

It follows that we should now drop down to the unit test level to ensure that our docking station has the necessary dock method to initially receive a bike:

```sh
require 'docking_station'
describe DockingStation do
  it { expect(subject).to respond_to :release_bike }
  it { expect(subject).to respond_to :dock }
end
```

[SHOW ALL THE SLIPS AND STEPS? INCLUDING RUBOCOP COMPLAINING ABOUT UNUSED ARGUMENTS]


```ruby
class DockingStation
  def release_bike
    Bike.new
  end

  def dock bike
    bike
  end
end

```

We know we may want to store multiple bikes, but let's do the simplest thing - just store one bike:

```ruby
class DockingStation

  def release_bike
    @bike
  end

  def dock bike
    @bike = bike
  end
end
```

```
class DockingStation
  attr_accessor :bike
  alias_method :release_bike, :bike
  alias_method :dock, :bike=
end
```

```
class DockingStation
  attr_accessor :bike
  alias_method :dock, :bike=

  def release_bike
    fail 'No Bikes Available' unless @bike
    @bike
  end
end
```

It might seem trivial, but what we've done here is model a docking station that can accept a single bike.  We know that they'll need to store more bikes in future, but particularly when learning it is highly instructive to work carefully through much simpler versions of a system.  Also surprisingly even for experts it's often a great idea to play with super-simplified versions of a system version, before gradually increasing the complexity level.

### Making the broken? method work properly

You may feel suspicious that our unit test passes while we don't have much code just yet. You're right, we're missing something. We're missing more examples! Let's write another one to enable the bike to be broken. After all, if the bike has both states, fixed and broken, it's fair to assume we'll need a method to break a bike as well.

````ruby
it 'should be able to break' do
  bike = Bike.new
  bike.break!
  expect(bike).to be_broken
end
````

So in our example we are creating a new bike, telling it to break and finally we expect it to be broken.

Before you run the example, ask yourself again. What do you expect to see? Will it pass? Will it fail? Why? _It is a good practice if you get yourself into this mode of thinking_

This is the test output:

````ruby
1) Bike should be able to break
     Failure/Error: bike.break!
     NoMethodError:
       undefined method `break!' for #<Bike:0x007fe7a23fd7c0>
     # ./spec/bike_spec.rb:16:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'
````

If we run it, we find out that it fails on `bike.break!` statement because of the `break!` method has not been defined on `Bike`. Fair enough, let's add it to our `Bike` class. Again, [rspec](http://rspec.info) complained about the lack of method, so we're doing the absolute minimum to make our code work.

````ruby
class Bike
  def broken?
  end

  def break!
  end
end
````

_Will the test pass this time? If not, will the error be different? If yes, what will it be?_

Ok, the example is telling us that we expect the bike to be broken but it isn't: the `broken?` method returns `nil` while we expect it to return `true`. _What does it tell us to do?_ If we just make it return `true`, the example will pass but then our first example will fail because it only works because `broken?` is returning nil at the moment ( _and `nil` happens to equal to `false`_ ).

Time to write some real code. Now we have two examples that force us to write some logic. Apparently, our bike should maintain some internal state that should be changed when we break it.

Let's introduce an instance variable that holds this information. This must be an instance variable because this data is applicable only to a specific instance of the `Bike` class. One bike (instance of `Bike`) may be broken, whereas another one may not be. So we need an instance variable to save it.

````ruby
class Bike

  # the initialize method is always called when you create a new
  # class by typing Bike.new
  def initialize
    # all instance variables begin with "@"
    # this must be an instance variable because we'll need it
    # in other methods
    @broken = false
  end

  def broken?
    # instance variables are accessible in all methods
    @broken
  end

  def break!
    # and any instance method can update them
    @broken = true
  end

end
````

**Now all our examples pass, a perfect time to commit our changes. Since our repository is not empty anymore, push it to Github (:pill: [Version Control with Git](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/git.md)), and this can also be a good time switch Driver/Navigator Roles again&nbsp;:twisted_rightwards_arrows: if someones been driving for too long.

### Fixing the bike

If a bike can be broken, it can be fixed too, right? Sounds like a test.

````ruby
it 'should be able to get fixed' do
  bike = Bike.new
  bike.break!
  bike.fix!
  expect(bike).not_to be_broken
end
````

Why don't we assert that it's broken after we break but before we fix it? Also, why don't we assert that it's not broken before we break it? Because these cases are covered by other examples. We don't want to test the same thing again, it would be a waste of time. Other examples make sure that a new bike is not broken and, after we break it, it is broken.

If we run the test, we'll find that the method `fix!()` is undefined.

````ruby
1) Bike should be able to get fixed
     Failure/Error: bike.fix!
     NoMethodError:
       undefined method `fix!' for #<Bike:0x007fe9ed903010 @broken=true>
     # ./spec/bike_spec.rb:23:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'
````

Easy enough to fix it ( _pun intended_). Add the method to the class.

````ruby
def fix!
end
````

Again, don't write the implementation even though it may be obvious to you. Run the example again. What message do you expect to see this time?

````ruby
1) Bike should be able to get fixed
     Failure/Error: expect(bike).not_to be_broken
       expected broken? to return false, got true
     # ./spec/bike_spec.rb:24:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'
````

As you can see the message changed. In fact this is one of the _little tricks_ you can use to learn your way around rspec. While you are in the TDD cycle, just make sure to change the message rspec gives you with every run of rspec.

So, the example tells us that the bike should not be broken after we fix it but it actually is. Now it's a good time to implement the `fix!()` method.

````ruby
def fix!
  @broken = false
end
````

**Do you expect the tests to pass?** Check it to make sure they do.


Now it's a good time to check in the code. Stage and commit the files that changed and push to Github. It's a good practice to commit every time you are _green_.  It's also a good time to switch Driver/Navigator Roles&nbsp;:twisted_rightwards_arrows:, depending on your pairing methodology.


## Version 2: Refactoring

[TODO: use of subjects would annull the second refactoring here - could use a context/describe to extract subject/bike.break from a couple of tests]

Let's pause for a while before continuing implementing more features. Is our code really good? Is there any chance to refactor it?

Refactoring is the process of changing the structure of the code in order to make it more readable, maintainable or extendable without adding any new functionality.

Software developers, even (and especially) experienced ones, don't write perfect code on their first attempt. First you write the code that works, then you refactor it to make it good. Let's refactor the code we have so far.

Before starting refactoring, always make sure all the examples pass. If your examples fail or if you have no examples, you have no idea whether your refactored code is doing the same thing as before. Just hoping that it does is not enough: some changes in functionality are subtle and non-obvious even to experienced developers and may produce ripple effects. So, make sure the examples pass before you begin.

Take a look at the `Bike` class. What is the most obvious thing that is wrong here? Think for yourself before reading the answer below.

````ruby
class Bike

  def initialize
    @broken = false
  end

  def broken?
    @broken
  end

  def break!
    @broken = true
  end

  def fix!
    @broken = false
  end

end
````

One of the problems is the code repetition. Lines 4 and 16 are the same. Code repetition violates the **DRY principle**: [Don't Repeat Yourself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself). Repeating anything in the code or system design is a possible source of nasty bugs.

Instead of setting the instance variable in the initialiser, let's call the `fix!()` method instead.

Now run your tests to see if they pass. They should. This is how you know that the refactoring was successful: it didn't change the functionality while reducing the repetition in the code.

Now take a look at the tests. What could be improved here?

````ruby
require './lib/bike'

describe Bike do

  it 'should not be broken after we create it' do
    bike = Bike.new
    expect(bike).not_to be_broken
  end

  it 'should be able to break' do
    bike = Bike.new
    bike.break!
    expect(bike).to be_broken
  end

  it 'should be able to get fixed' do
    bike = Bike.new
    bike.break!
    bike.fix!
    expect(bike).not_to be_broken
  end

end
````

It should be obvious by now that lines 6, 11 and 17 are crying to be refactored. We're doing the same operation at the start of every test. Fortunately, rspec provides a way to define variables that are used by all tests. Try this:

````ruby
require './lib/bike'

describe Bike do

  let(:bike) { Bike.new }

  it 'should not be broken after we create it' do
    expect(bike).not_to be_broken
  end

  it 'should be able to break' do
    bike.break!
    expect(bike).to be_broken
  end

  it 'should be able to get fixed' do
    bike.break!
    bike.fix!
    expect(bike).not_to be_broken
  end

end
````

Line 5 calls an rspec helper `let()` that defines a local variable "bike" using the block provided (`{ Bike.new }`) before every test. This makes our tests more DRY. Run them to see if they still work. They should.

Even though there are other repeated lines (8 and 19), it doesn't make sense to extract them into their own methods for readability's sake. However, in some cases it may be better to extract them: always use your best judgement. The code should look and feel elegant to you.  

Note also that each time that you extract a commonality that you are adding a dependency.  DRYing out your code is very important, but developing an intuition for when to do it is critical.

Now that we've finished with refactoring, it's a good time to push to Github and to switch Driver/Navigator Roles&nbsp;:twisted_rightwards_arrows:.
