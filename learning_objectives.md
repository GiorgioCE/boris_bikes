## Summary of learning objectives for the week

Agile
* **SCAFFOLD** define an 'Agile process' [[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) *(reading)*, [Agile Manifesto Principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) *(reading)*]
* **SCAFFOLD** discriminate between 'Agile' and 'non-Agile' processes, such as 'Waterfall' [[Scrum Reference Card](http://scrumreferencecard.com/scrum-reference-card/) *(reading, visual)*]
* explain why **Makers Academy** do Agile

BDD
* **SCAFFOLD** define 'user story' [[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) *(reading)*, [Agile Modelling: User Stories Introduction](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/userStory.htm) *(reading)*]
* **SCAFFOLD** define 'domain model' [[Samm's brief introduction](http://blog.sjmog.co/2015/03/11/a-brief-introduction-to-domain-modelling/) *(reading)*, [Scaled Agile Framework: Domain Modelling](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/domain-modeling/) *(reading)*]
* **SCAFFOLD** define 'class structure' [[Samm's brief introduction](http://blog.sjmog.co/2015/03/11/whats-a-class-structure/)]
* illustrate links between user stories, domain models, and class structures
* build a class structure from a user story, translating through a domain model
* decide whether 'Agile' processes require a domain model first, or if a domain model can emerge for retrospective use

* **SCAFFOLD** remember what Enough Design Up Front (EDUF), Big Design Up Front (BDUF), and No Design Up Front (NDUF) mean in the context of software design [[Samm's brief introduction](http://blog.sjmog.co/2015/03/12/software-design-up-front-how-much/)]
* explain the motives behind EDUF, BDUF, and NDUF
* justify why EDUF is more valuable in an Agile context than BDUF or NDUF

* can differentiate between 'unit', 'integration' and 'feature' tests
* construct a feature/integration test

TDD 
* **SCAFFOLD** remember that 'TDD' refers to 'Test-Driven Development'
* **SCAFFOLD** explain what TDD is
* identify why we do TDD at Makers Academy
* defend TDD against alternative development methods

* **SCAFFOLD** define RSpec as a testing framework that encourages TDD
* state RSpec 'best practices' using `describe`, `context`, and `it`
* illustrate links between TDD and RSpec
* initialize a new project for TDD with RSpec
* implement RSpec best practices
* infer why we always do the simplest thing first

Clean Code
* **SCAFFOLD** know how to access style guidelines
* use style guidelines in practices
* **EXTENSION** compare different style guidelines
* **EXTENSION** criticize a non-Makers styleguide

Doubles
* **SCAFFOLD** recall what a double is
* **SCAFFOLD** explain what a double does
* outline why doubles are used
* use doubles to test message expectations
* use doubles to stub unpredictable behaviour

* compare and contrast 'London' and 'Chicago' styles

Pair Programming
* **SCAFFOLD** define 'pair programming'
* explain how pair programming works
* argue why pair programming is often better than solo programming
* use git and GitHub to share code with pair partner
* evaluate how pair programming with a new partner every day has developed their proficiency in other topics, and more generally



### Activities
* Use TDD and pair programming together to create a simple model of the Boris Bikes problem in Ruby.
* Use TDD and pair programming together to approach a slightly more complex model (e.g. Airports) which requires wider use of doubles.
