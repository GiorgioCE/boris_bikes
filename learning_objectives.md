## Summary of learning objectives for the week

Agile
* can explain why we do agile

BDD
* can define the meanings user story, domain model, class structure
* understand how to translate between these concepts
* build a class structure from a user story, translating through a domain model
* can explain the difference between EDUF (enough design up front) over BDUF or NDUF  (big design up front/ no design up front
* can differentiate between unit, integration and feature test
* can construct a feature/integration test
* MVP?

TDD 
* Can explain why we do TDD (e.g. code documentation, for quality, enabling emergent (incremental?) design)
* Can initialize a new project for TDD with RSpec
* Follows RSpec best practices for writing tests using describe/context/it
Pairing
* can explain why we always do the simplest thing first (Building incrementally using iterations, Fail fast and rapid feedback)

Clean Code
* Can follow style guidelines

Doubles
* Can explain what doubles are and what they do and why we use them
* Can explain difference between London and Chicago Style
* Can use doubles to test message expectations
* Can use doubles to stub unpredictable behaviour

Pair Programming
* can explain why we pair program
* can use git and github to share code with pair partner
* Has pair-programmed every day, with a new partner each day



### Activities
* Use TDD and pair programming together to create a simple model of the Boris Bikes problem in Ruby.
* Use TDD and pair programming together to approach a slightly more complex model (e.g. Airports) which requires wider use of doubles.
