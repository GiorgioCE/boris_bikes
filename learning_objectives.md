### Activities
* Use BDD/TDD and pair programming together to create a simple model of the Boris Bikes problem in Ruby.
* Use BDD/TDD and solo programming to approach a slightly more complex model (e.g. Airports) which requires wider use of doubles.

Weekly Challenge
===========

## Airport

**Learning Objectives**

* Simple OOD and OOP creating and linking at least two objects via composition
* Mocking random behaviour effectively in order to ensure consistent and reliable tests
* Test driven development (TDD)

## Tube

**Learning Objectives**

* Simple OOD and OOP creating and linking at least two objects via composition
* Writing effective tests, i.e. doing TDD
