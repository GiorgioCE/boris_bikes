## Summary of learning objectives for the week

*Under Construction - Sam and I have split the learning into Topics, and I have scaffolded learning objectives from 'basic' to 'complex' within each. I have highlighted which are <SCAFFOLD> learning objectives that students should be able to approach on their own (and provided some sample resources I'd give to students so they arrive proficient in those LOs), and which are <EXTENSION> learning objectives you might want to suggest for more advanced students. Using verbs like 'define', 'explain', 'outline' gives an idea as to how to assess a student's proficiency in a certain learning objective. The objectives are nowhere near exhaustive, but hopefully they offer a framework for **all students** so they are proceeding from week-to-week with no gaps in knowledge (which can make for nasty surprises later on!). Edits, feedback, etc, are super-welcome (I've asked questions in italics but please poke in if you feel something needs to be said anywhere). Sam J and I discussed sharing these learning objectives with students and encouraging them to submit PRs for changes if they don't feel the LOs are appropriate - more feedback for us, and a more tailored course for future cohorts. What do you think?*

Agile
* <SCAFFOLD> define an 'Agile process' [[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) *(reading)*, [Agile Manifesto Principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) *(reading)*]
* <SCAFFOLD> discriminate between 'Agile' and 'non-Agile' processes, such as 'Waterfall' [[Scrum Reference Card](http://scrumreferencecard.com/scrum-reference-card/) *(reading, visual)*]
* explain why **Makers Academy** do Agile

BDD
* <SCAFFOLD> define 'user story' [[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) *(reading)*, [Agile Modelling: User Stories Introduction](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/userStory.htm) *(reading)*]
* <SCAFFOLD> define 'domain model' [[Samm's brief introduction](http://blog.sjmog.co/2015/03/11/a-brief-introduction-to-domain-modelling/) *(reading)*, [Scaled Agile Framework: Domain Modelling](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/domain-modeling/) *(reading)*]
* <SCAFFOLD> define 'class structure' [[Samm's brief introduction](http://blog.sjmog.co/2015/03/11/whats-a-class-structure/)]
* illustrate links between user stories, domain models, and class structures
* build a class structure from a user story, translating through a domain model
* decide whether 'Agile' processes require a domain model first, or if a domain model can be used retrospectively (*Sam J does this fit with your Agile process we were discussing?*)

* <SCAFFOLD> remember what Enough Design Up Front (EDUF), Big Design Up Front (BDUF), and No Design Up Front (NDUF) mean in the context of software design
* explain the motives behind EDUF, BDUF, and NDUF
* justify why EDUF is more valuable in an Agile context than BDUF or NDUF

* can differentiate between 'unit', 'integration' and 'feature' tests
* construct a feature/integration test
---
* MVP? (*What is our thinking on this? Do students need to be able to define this, explain it to someone, argue why it's good...or just leave it as extension material?*)
---

TDD 
* <SCAFFOLD> remember that 'TDD' refers to 'Test-Driven Development'
* <SCAFFOLD> explain what TDD is
* identify why we do TDD at Makers Academy
* defend TDD against alternative development methods

* <SCAFFOLD> define RSpec as a testing framework that encourages TDD (*What do we think of this definition? Should this be broader - i.e. 'recall what RSpec is' with articles?*)
* state RSpec 'best practices' using `describe`, `context`, and `it`
* illustrate links between TDD and RSpec
* initialize a new project for TDD with RSpec
* implement RSpec best practices
* infer why we always do the simplest thing first

Clean Code
* <SCAFFOLD> know how to access style guidelines
* use style guidelines in practices
* <EXTENSION> compare different style guidelines
* <EXTENSION> criticize a non-Makers styleguide

Doubles
* <SCAFFOLD> recall what a double is
* <SCAFFOLD> explain what a double does
* outline why doubles are used
* use doubles to test message expectations
* use doubles to stub unpredictable behaviour

* compare and contrast 'London' and 'Chicago' styles (*Does this belong better in the TDD topic?*)

Pair Programming
* <SCAFFOLD> define 'pair programming'
* explain how pair programming works
* argue why pair programming is often better than solo programming
* use git and GitHub to share code with pair partner
* evaluate how pair programming with a new partner every day has developed their proficiency in other topics, and more generally



### Activities
* Use TDD and pair programming together to create a simple model of the Boris Bikes problem in Ruby.
* Use TDD and pair programming together to approach a slightly more complex model (e.g. Airports) which requires wider use of doubles.
