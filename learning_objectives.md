## Summary of learning objectives for the week

* Can initialize a new project for TDD with RSpec
* Follows RSpec best practices for writing tests using describe/context/it
* Can use doubles to test message expectations
* Can use doubles to stub unpredictable behaviour
* Can discuss the philosophy of TDD and understands its role in:
    * Documenting code
    * Ensuring quality
    * Enabling emergent design
* Has pair-programmed every day, with a new partner each day
* Can discuss the philosophy of pair programming and identify at least one individual learning that would not have happened without it.
* Can use Git and GitHub to create and share repositories with a pair partner
* Has a basic understanding of Agile principles, in particular:
    * EDUF (enough design up front) over BDUF or NDUF  (big design up front/ no design up front)
    * Fail fast and rapid feedback
    * Building incrementally using iterations
* Has a basic understanding of MVP

### Activities
* Use TDD and pair programming together to create a simple model of the Boris Bikes problem in Ruby.
* Use TDD and pair programming together to approach a slightly more complex model (e.g. Airports) which requires wider use of doubles.
