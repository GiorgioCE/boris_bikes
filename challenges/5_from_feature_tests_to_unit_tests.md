# From Feature Tests to Unit Tests

You should now understand that our error happened because Ruby doesn't know what a `DockingStation` is. Ruby doesn't know this because you haven't told it about `DockingStation`s: you just asked Ruby to make you a new one.

Ruby errors are quite helpful, but they don't tell you exactly how to solve them. For that, you need a testing framework.

In this challenge, you will initialize a testing framework, **RSpec**, and plan your DockingStation with a **Unit Test**.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Define RSpec as a testing framework
- Create a spec file
- Describe an Object using a spec
- Set up a unit test

### Self-assessment

To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Initialize RSpec within your project
- [ ] Create a new spec file for your DockingStation object
- [ ] Set up the spec file to `describe` a DockingStation
- [ ] Run RSpec from the Command Line
- [ ] Explain to your pair partner the difference between this error and the error you saw before.
