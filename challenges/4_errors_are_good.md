# Errors are good

You should have just gotten an error something like this:

```sh
NameError: uninitialized constant DockingStation
  from (irb):1
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.2/bin/irb:11:in '<main>'
```

Errors are good. They tell us what the problem is and point us towards where we can go to fix it. Much of a developer's time is spent reading, researching, and understanding the result of error messages.

In this challenge, you will dissect a Command Line error message.
